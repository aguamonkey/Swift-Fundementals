// This is how you establish a variable or a constants. Variables can change but constants cannot. You set a variable with var. You set a constant with let.

var highScore = 0

// High Score can be assigned a new value as it is a variable
highScore = 55

let myName = "Josh"

// I could not assign a new name to myName as it is a constant

// The below code would throw an error:
myName = "Tom"
